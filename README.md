About series:
Portal2 Tool Box(Original named Portal2 AIO Super Launcher) was established 
when I was 14 years old.The software greatly helped many non-steam players 
enjoy their Portal2 coop mode smoothly.The series includes three generations 
and one pre-alpha version.Because I did't get through to something about UI,
I used SkinH and its dll files to help decorating the software.It has been 6
years since the first version released(by YQ880 tool).

Nearly all the codes are by Garry101CN(JIANG Xilai), Screenshake (in chatting room)
was by Mo10.Some functions need Internet connection.If you don't, they will not work.
The sever (URL:coacle.com) was rented from CNDNS.com.
